A sequence of immutable records called blocks -- BlockChain
A blockchain has: 
   - A list of blocks
   - More than one nodes
   - a consensus algorithm
   - The nodes act as peers in the blockchain network
A Block has
   - a hash
   - a nounce
   - prev hash
   - list of transactions
   - index 
Should have the following methods
   - An end point to create a new block with transactions
   - An end point to create a new digitally signed transactions
   - A means to hash a block(SHA256 or SHA512)

A consensus algorithm to check the validity of new blocks 

A miner to add current transactions to a new block, and also a hash puzzle to create a sort of race amoung the miners(Also to stop attacks and spamming,ie miners should provide a proof of 
work of sorts aka PoW)
